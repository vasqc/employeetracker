# employeetracker
This week I was given no stater code and was tasked with creating an application that would allow business owners to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they will be better prepared to organize and plan their business. Upon starting up the application, the user should be presented with a prompt that asks them what they would like to do, and the user is provided with the choice to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
